## Feature Patterns

### What Works Well
- Clear user stories with "As a... I want... So that..."
- Numbered acceptance criteria
- Explicit scope boundaries
- Complexity estimates with ranges

### Common Pitfalls
- Vague criteria like "should be fast"
- Missing edge cases
- Undefined error states
- Scope creep mid-development

## Priority Framework

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Urgent | Blocks other work, security issue, major bug |
| High | Core functionality, high user impact |
| Medium | Important but not blocking |
| Low | Nice to have, future consideration |

---

## Estimation Guide

| Size | Typical Hours | Characteristics |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| S | 1-2 | Single component, clear scope |
| M | 3-6 | Multiple components, some complexity |
| L | 8-16 | Cross-cutting, dependencies |
| XL | 20+ | Major feature, break it down |
