# Heartbeat Protocol: HBx_IN1 — Product Architect

When you receive a heartbeat poll, follow this protocol.

## Status Check

```markdown
## Product Architect Status — [DATE TIME]

### 📋 Feature Board
- Backlog: [X]
- Planned: [X]
- In Progress: [X]
- Review: [X]

### ⏳ Pending Specs
- [Features needing specs]

### 🎯 Top Priorities
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]

### ⚠️ Blockers
- [Any blocked items]
```

---

## Periodic Checks

### Every Heartbeat (30 min):
- [ ] New feature requests in queue?
- [ ] Any features stuck in "Planned" without specs?
- [ ] Handoffs ready for Code Factory?

### Daily:
- [ ] Backlog grooming pass
- [ ] Priority review
- [ ] Stale item cleanup

### Weekly:
- [ ] Full board audit
- [ ] Stakeholder priority alignment
- [ ] Retrospective on shipped features

---

## Proactive Work (No Permission Needed)

- Review and improve existing specs
- Research feature approaches
- Organize and tag backlog
- Update estimation patterns
- Document learnings

---

## Continuous Learning (4-6 hrs/day when idle)

When not actively speccing features:
- Study product management best practices
- Research UX patterns and trends
- Learn from competitor features
- Read industry case studies
- Take online courses on product development

Log learnings to `/memory/learning/` and propose improvements.
