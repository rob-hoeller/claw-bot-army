# Memory: 2026-02-19

## Session Summary

Session with Lance — platform check-in and memory logging fix.

## Key Work Completed

### 1. Platform Status Verified
- HBx online, all systems green
- 8 agents registered (2 active, 6 deploying)
- OpenClaw 2026.2.15 running on Claude Opus 4.6

### 2. Weather Query
- Pulled weather for Orlando, FL (84°F, clear) and Lewes, DE (41°F, overcast)

### 3. Memory Logging Fixed
**Problem:** Daily memory logs stopped after Feb 15. No automated process was creating `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files or logging to Supabase `memory_logs` table.

**Root Cause:** The existing cron ("HBx Memory Sync") only syncs config FROM Supabase — it doesn't create daily memory files or log TO the memory_logs table.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `scripts/daily-memory-log.sh` — creates daily memory file + logs to Supabase
- Added cron job "Daily Memory Log" — runs at 11 PM ET daily
- Runs as isolated agent session to generate meaningful daily summaries
- Verified end-to-end: local file created + Supabase `memory_logs` row confirmed

### 4. Existing Infrastructure Confirmed Working
- `scripts/add-memory.sh` — works (logs to both agents.memory_md + memory_logs)
- `scripts/sync-agent-config.sh` — works (pulls config from Supabase)
- `memory_logs` Supabase table — operational, 3 records now
