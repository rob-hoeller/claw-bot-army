## Session Activity (Updated 2026-02-22T21:20Z)

### IN3 CRM Research Report — Delivered
- IN3 completed deep CRM research (from prior session): Attio vs Zoho vs Build-Our-Own
- **Recommendation:** Hybrid — Attio as CRM backbone + custom HBx modules
- Full report at `/specs/crm-research-report.md` + PDF sent to Lance via Telegram
- Installed pandoc + wkhtmltopdf to generate PDF (Lance noted: ask before installing packages in future)

### PRs 57-59 Merged & Pulled
- **PR #57:** Done tracker color fix (purple → green)
- **PR #58:** File attachment processing — PDF text extraction in dashboard chat
- **PR #59:** Approve webhook — auto-notify HBx when feature moves to approved
- Pulled to main, resolved MEMORY.md merge conflict (took remote)
- **34 stale local branches cleaned up**

### PR #60 Merged (detected by poller)
- "Cost Tracking for Features Table" — merged by Rob
- Added DashboardChatPanel.tsx, chat types, FeatureBoard.tsx updates, useFeatureChat hook
- No matching feature card found (no card was created for this one)

### OpenClaw Config Changes
- **`messages.suppressToolErrors: true`** — stops ⚠️ tool error warnings from leaking into Telegram
- **`tools.exec.notifyOnExit: false`** — stops background exec completion notifications in chat
- Both were default OpenClaw behaviors, not related to any PR

### PR Merge Automation Built
- Created `scripts/poll-merged-prs.sh` — polls GitHub every 15 min for merged PRs
- Auto-updates Supabase feature cards to "done" on merge
- Pulls main + prunes merged branches (local + remote)
- **Cron job `poll-merged-prs` running every 15 min** (job ID: 06c27b94-258d-4051-b330-441c8ddc87b8)
- Created `docs/setup/github-webhook-setup.md` with instructions for Rob

### GitHub Webhook — Live ✅
- Rob configured GitHub webhook → `https://claw-bot-army.vercel.app/api/webhooks/github`
- First ping failed (405 — wrong URL), second succeeded after correcting to full path
- Webhook endpoint was already in codebase (PR #59) — just needed GitHub-side wiring
- Both webhook (real-time) and cron poller (15 min fallback) now active

### Health Check Summary
- **Security audit:** 1 critical (Tailscale Funnel exposed), 2 warn (no trusted proxies, password in config)
- **OpenClaw update available:** 2026.2.15 → 2026.2.21-2 (not applied — Lance deferred)
- **No UFW installed** — only Tailscale iptables chains, INPUT policy ACCEPT
- **Python service on 0.0.0.0:8090** — publicly exposed
- **SSH on 0.0.0.0:22** — publicly exposed

### Pending Items
- Lance hasn't decided yet on creating a PR for uncommitted files (poll script, webhook docs, CRM report)
- CRM decision (Attio hybrid) awaiting Lance's go-ahead
- OpenClaw update deferred
- Security hardening recommendations provided but not acted on
