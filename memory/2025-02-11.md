## HBx Dashboard Progress

### PRs Merged Today
- PR #19: Phase 4a - Compact UI + Feature Detail Panel + Schema (merged ~18:04 UTC)
- PR #20: Innovation Department Agents - 28 MD files + UI updates (merged ~19:42 UTC)

### Key Work Completed
- Feature Board UI with detail side panel (slide-out, expandable)
- UI compactness overhaul (~0.5x density)
- Supabase schema: `002_phase4_schema.sql` (features, bugs, learning_logs tables)
- Created Innovation Dept agents: HBx_IN1 (Product Architect 📐), HBx_IN2 (Code Factory 🏭), HBx_IN3 (Research Lab 🔬), HBx_SP1 (Support/Bug Triage 🛟)
- All agent files in `workspace/agents/HBx_IN{1,2,3}/` and `HBx_SP1/`
- Gateway chatCompletions enabled, Tailscale funnel mode set

### Tailscale Funnel - BLOCKED
- Multiple attempts to get Funnel + local webchat working simultaneously
- Config: `bind: "loopback"` + `tailscale.mode: "funnel"` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- `bind: "tailnet"` was tried but gateway wouldn't start
- Backup at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.backup-20260211-164603`
- Tailscale DNS: `ip-172-31-70-66.tailf479a9.ts.net`
- Gateway port: 18789
- User frustrated - wants clear definitive config path
- Was reading OpenClaw docs: `gateway/tailscale.md`, `gateway/configuration.md`, `web/webchat.md`, `gateway/configuration-examples.md`
- Next: find correct config, Rob restarts gateway, verify, set Vercel env vars

### Repo Info
- Repo: `rob-hoeller/claw-bot-army` on GitHub
- Current branch: `main` (commit `640232c`)
- PR reviewers: `rob-hoeller` and `RobLepard`
- Git creds in `~/.git-credentials` (credential.helper=store)
- Old branches to clean: `hbx/innovation-agents`, `hbx/phase4-schema`

### Next Steps
1. Resolve Tailscale Funnel config (read docs thoroughly)
2. Set Vercel env vars: `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
3. Test live chat Vercel → Gateway
4. Phase 4f: Agent-to-agent communication + task flow

### Key Decisions
- Supabase for all persistence
- Admin read-only chat viewing (input hidden)
- Half-page panel default (600-700px)
- HBx = Platform Director role
- Agent learning: 4-6 hrs/day education, logged to `learning_logs`
- Fresh branches off main for each PR
- GitHub API curl for PRs (no gh CLI)
