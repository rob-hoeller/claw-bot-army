## Session Notes

### Multi-Agent Fleet Management Concept
- Lance shared a Fleet Commander SOUL.md concept (generated by another OpenClaw instance)
- Concept: central ops hub monitoring costs, health, activity across bot fleet
- Existing agents defined in `workspace/agents/`: HBx_IN1, IN2, IN3, SP1
- Key open questions: who am I (HBx or Fleet Commander?), deployment model, monitoring scope, stakeholders
- Tracked in `/docs/BACKLOG.md` under "Concepts / Discovery"
- Lance doesn't have answers yet — needs further definition

### Identity Status
- This instance has no defined identity yet (SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md are default templates)
- Awaiting clarification on role before defining identity
